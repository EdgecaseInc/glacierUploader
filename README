===========================
Purpose:
===========================


    This utility allows the user to upload files to Amazon Glacier via 
    python 2.7 via boto.




===========================
Usage (From commandline):
===========================


    glacierUpload.py [-h] [--vault VAULT] [--key KEY] [--secret SECRET]
                     [--file FILE] [--description DESC]
                     [--inventory INVENTORY]

    Arguments:
     -h, --help             Show this help message and exit

     --vault VAULT          AWS Glacier Vault

    --key KEY               AWS API Key Id (aws_awsKeyId)

    --secret SECRET         AWS secret (aws_secret_access_key)

    --file FILE             Path and filename (upload source)

    --description DESC      Optional description.

    --inventory INVENTORY   Inventory file where we track what is uploaded.


    NOTE: If the vault name given does not exist, the script will create it
          first.



===========================
Usage: (From Other Scripts):
===========================


    import glacierUpload
    glacierUpload.upload(
                        awsKeyId,
                        awsSecret,
                        awsVault,
                        fileName,
                        inventory,
                        description=None
    )



===========================
Known Issues:
===========================


(1) Be sure your system clock is synchronized.  Failure to sync the system clock will encounter a "Signature expired" message.  For Linux systems, it is
suggested that using ntpdate to synchronize the clock is a simple solution.  In
Debian, this is done by executing--

    sudo apt-get install ntpdate -y
    ntpdate 0.pool.ntp.org

(2) Be sure to verify that your inventory path/filename are writable.  Do not
lose the inventory file.  It is the only means of identifying what is uploaded
into your Glacier vaults.
